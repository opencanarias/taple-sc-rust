# TAPLE Rust Smart Contract SDK
TAPLE (pronounced T+üçé ['tap…ôl]) stands for Tracking (Autonomous) of Provenance and Lifecycle Events. TAPLE is a permissioned DLT solution for traceability of assets and processes. It is:

- **Scalable**: Scaling to a sufficient level for traceability use cases. 
- **Light**: Designed to support resource constrained devices.
- **Flexible**: Have a flexible and adaptable cryptographic scheme mechanism for a multitude of scenarios.
- **Energy-efficient**: Rust powered, TAPLE is sustainable and efficient from the point of view of energy consumption.

This project includes the SDK to be included during the development of smart contracts for TAPLE.
